Topic 2 - Getting info from databases

1. The school database was already present in the list of databases so no need to import.
2. Use 'DESCRIBE' to show type column which includes maximum length thresholds. - 20
3. Primary key is 'tid', again describe shows makeup of table.
4. Primary key is 'name', again describe shows makeup of table.
5. SELECT * FROM 'subject' shows all data in the table.

6. SELECT name, OnLeavingCert 
   FROM subject
   WHERE OnLeavingCert = 1;
   
   	Select the columns I visualized needing and then applied WHERE to the dependent column.

7.SELECT name, level
  FROM Teacher
  WHERE level = "L";
	Select the columns I visualized needing and then applied WHERE to the dependent column.

8. SELECT Name, Teacher FROM subject
   WHERE Teacher NOT LIKE "%Mr.%"
	You can use regex in sql queries, who knew?!

9. SELECT * FROM teacher
   WHERE (MONTH(dob) IN (1,2,3))
   AND level = "J"
	I tried to use regex to return last 4 digits of dob less than 301 but couldn't get it to work. MONTH 	function is far easier when dealing with date type. 1,2,3 are simple Jan, Feb, Mar.

10. Stuck, there has to be a clever way to do this.. I might not even need the name column
    SELECT DISTINCT MONTHNAME(dob) FROM teacher;

11. Show all details of all teachers, sorted by first by experience, then level.
    SELECT * FROM teacher
    ORDER BY experience, level;

12. Show all details of all subjects whose 3rd or 4th letter is “l”. Sort them by name.
    SELECT * FROM subject
    WHERE Name like "%__l%"
    AND Name like "%___l%"
    ORDER BY name;
	When using the WHERE along with AND/OR, you don't need to restate the WHERE.


13. Show the name of all teachers who have 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 or 60 years
experience. Sort from youngest to oldest
    SELECT name, experience FROM subject
    WHERE experience % 5 = 0;
	One shot it! Modulus saves the day again! Patterns baby!
