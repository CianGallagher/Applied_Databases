**Topic 2 - Getting info from databases**

1. 	The school database was already present in the list of databases so no need to import.
2. 	Use 'DESCRIBE' to show type column which includes maximum length thresholds. - 20
3. 	Primary key is 'tid', again describe shows makeup of table.
4. 	Primary key is 'name', again describe shows makeup of table.
5. 	SELECT * FROM 'subject' shows all data in the table.

6. 	SELECT name, OnLeavingCert 
   	FROM subject
   	WHERE OnLeavingCert = 1;
   
   	Select the columns I visualized needing and then applied WHERE to the dependent column.

7.	SELECT name, level
  	FROM Teacher
  	WHERE level = "L";
	Select the columns I visualized needing and then applied WHERE to the dependent column.

8. 	SELECT Name, Teacher FROM subject
  	WHERE Teacher NOT LIKE "%Mr.%"
	You can use regex in sql queries, who knew?!

9. 	SELECT * FROM teacher
   	WHERE (MONTH(dob) IN (1,2,3))
   	AND level = "J"
	I tried to use regex to return last 4 digits of dob less than 301 but couldn't get it to work. MONTH 	function is far easier when dealing with date type. 1,2,3 are simple Jan, Feb, Mar.

10. 	SELECT DISTINCT MONTHNAME(dob) FROM teacher;

11. 	Show all details of all teachers, sorted by first by experience, then level.
    	SELECT * FROM teacher
    	ORDER BY experience, level;

12.	Show all details of all subjects whose 3rd or 4th letter is “l”. Sort them by name.
    	SELECT * FROM subject
    	WHERE Name like "%__l%"
    	AND Name like "%___l%"
    	ORDER BY name;
	When using the WHERE along with AND/OR, you don't need to restate the WHERE.


13. 	Show the name of all teachers who have 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 or 60 years
	experience. Sort from youngest to oldest
    	SELECT name, experience FROM subject
    	WHERE experience % 5 = 0
    	ORDER BY dob desc;
	One shot it! Modulus saves the day again! Patterns baby! This only works I know all the experiences.
    



** Topic 3 - Functions & Procedures **

1. 	Imported database using " mysql>SOURCE C:\Users\appDB\Desktop\employees.sql "
   	Verified database was present using show databases, use employees, and describe tables.


2. 	Print out the emp_no, first_name and a capitalised version of the employees last_name,
	using the same column names that are in the table for the first 10 employees returned from
	the database.

	mysql> select emp_no, first_name, upper(last_name)
   	from employees
    	limit 10;

3. 	Sort the employees table based on:
	• The length of last_name
	• Alphabetical order of last_name
	• The length of first_name
	• Alphabetical order of first_nam
	
	mysql> select * from employees
  	order by length(last_name), last_name, length(first_name),
	first_name;

4.	Show all details of the first 10 employees returned from the database and an extra column
	called Initials that shows the employee’s initials
	mysql> select *, concat(left(first_name, 1), left(last_name,1)) as Initials from employees;

	concat is very useful if you need to manipulate multiple columns and then join together the results.

5. 	Show all details of all Females born in the 1950s and hired between September 1st 1988 and
	February 28th 1991.
	
	mysql> select * from employees
	where gender like "f"
 	and birth_date like "__5%"
	and hire_date between "1988-09-01" and "1991-02-28";

** Topic 4 - Exercises **	
	 

3.	sql> select manu_code, manu_name,concat(left(manu_details, 10), "...")
    	from manufacturer;
		

4. 	mysql> SELECT FORMAT(AVG(LENGTH(manu_name)),0)
    	from manufacturer;

5.	mysql> select *, IF(fuel="petrol",1.45,1.30) as cost
	from vehicle;


6.	mysql> select v.reg, v.manu_code, m.manu_name
	from vehicle v
	inner join manufacturer m
	on v.manu_code = m.manu_code;


7.	mysql> select m.manu_code, m.manu_name, v.reg
	from manufacturer m
	inner join vehicle v
	on m.manu_code = v.manu_code;


8. 	mysql> select m.manu_code, m.manu_name, v.reg
	from manufacturer m
	left join vehicle v
	on m.manu_code = v.manu_code
